# flights-API

This is an flights API (Australia only) that I have created to access with my [Flyaway](https://kasiamisirli.github.io/flight_search_engine/) aplication.

## Access

Can be accesses with below url:
````https://flight-api-mbynoyjqmf.now.sh/flights```

To be able to pass in data in Node.js aplication, please bee below link:
````https://flight-api-mbynoyjqmf.now.sh/flights&origin=${this.state.origin}&destination=${this.state.destination}&year=${this.state.year}&month=${this.state.month}&day=${this.state.day}```
This: 
```${this.state.origin}``` must be replaced with a city name etc.

## Build with:
